Hello World project tutorial to get new GitHub Users started with GitHub.

Tutorial requested I write a bit about myself:
On GitHub, saved changes are called commits. Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of your changes, so other contributors can understand what youâ€™ve done and why.

Commit Message: To understand how to edit and comment on a branch.
